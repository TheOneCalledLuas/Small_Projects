# Small_Projects
List of all the small projects I've been developing throughout the year.

Every project is uploaded as a zip, which contains the resources and the 
main code file to allow the programme to work, if the main code file requires
from external resources. In case this doesn't take place, the main file is 
uploaded by itself.
All the programmes are coded with python v3.11.
